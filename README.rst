PennyLane-Qrack Plugin
#######################

The PennyLane-Qrack plugin integrates the Qrack quantum computing framework with PennyLane's quantum machine learning capabilities.

This plugin is addapted from the `PennyLane-Qulacs plugin, <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qulacs>`__ under the Apache License 2.0, with many thanks to the original developers!

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`__ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`vm6502q/qrack <https://github.com/vm6502q>`__ is a software library for quantum computing, written in C++ and with GPU support.

Features
========

* Provides access to a PyQrack simulator backend via the ``qrack.simulator`` device
